**OpenVPN Server TUN mode**

What is OpenVPN?
OpenVPN is an open-source software application that implements virtual private network (VPN) techniques for creating secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes SSL/TLS for key exchange. It is capable of traversing network address translators (NATs) and firewalls

This is an adaptation of the "OpenVPN Server TAP mode" from DeBaschdi that created a mod from "peterSM_1" to continue his work.

In this fork the intention is to change it so the TUN mode can be used instead of TAP

This is not yet working, I'll be updating this message to let you know when it will be working
